nutritious food affordable and accessible to everyone; the unique feature of our kitchens allows
them to be operated at any location and offer healthy food at a lower price compared to other
unhealthy fast food chains encouraging and enabling people to make healthy choices.

Introductiong
Founder Story:
Aswath, commonly known as Ash, is a Robotics graduate from the prestigious University of Bristol.
Ash's journey began with a disturbing experience during his master's degree. In 2019, he started his
master's degree with immense academic pressure, and due to a lack of time, he was unable to cook
healthy and nutritious food at home. This resulted in him depending heavily on cheap ultraprocessed and fast foods, which ultimately exacerbated his health problems. He was subsequently
diagnosed with malnutrition and a stomach ulcer. Nevertheless, after this traumatic experience, Ash
aspired to make fresh and healthy food available to all, anytime, anywhere.
In today's fast-paced and busy lifestyle, it is challenging for everyone to have the convenience and
patience of preparing healthy meals at home. Consequently, [1] the British diet has transformed
from consuming 54% fresh food in the 1980s to 80% ultra-processed food in late 2020. This shift is
strongly implicated in the increase in the number of people suffering from severe illnesses. In the
UK, [2] 4.8 million people live with diabetes, [3] while 7.6 million people suffer from cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Furthermore, 944,000 people have dementia, [4] and 3 million people have cancer
[5]. Despite elderly people residing in care homes, [6] shockingly, over 3 million elderly individuals
suffer from malnutrition. At the same time, [7] the UK is seeing a 35.5% of shortage in skilled food
service workers. While inflation is causing bills to go up, over 2.1 million people in the UK cannot
afford healthy food and are heavily relying on canned ultra-processed food from food banks.
However, research conducted in UWE Bristol Frenchay Campus found that 97% of people would
buy healthy food options if they were made convenient and cheaper. Currently, [8] the average price
of Healthy food is 3 times more Expensive, it is £8.51 for 1,000 calories compared to just £3.25
for 1,000 calories for an obesogenic unhealthy product. This price is projected to increase, due to
the 3.7% increase in [9] rising labour price and rising [10] Gas & electricity price which has
increased by 129.4% & 66.7% respectively.

Venture Launch:
With the growing demand for convenient, healthy and affordable food options, coming from diverse
groups, including Students, Professionals, and the Elderly like Peter from Stoke Gifford Village
Retirement Home Bristol, who says, “I love cooking but I’m getting weaker every day and I’m
losing my ability to cook. I have a caretaker now but she only microwaves frozen food or makes
simple sandwiches and now I hate frozen food. I’m also sick of having the same food from the cafe,
I would love to have my choice of meals meals anytime I want”. Ash established GI Healthcare
Industries Limited in May 2021.

Innovative Technologyg
GI Healthcare excels in providing affordable and nutritious food by
harnessing the potential of its Innovative technology, the advanced
autonomous cooking machine known as AstroChef. We have
designed AstroChef to be compact, allowing it to seamlessly fit
within confined spaces and it has been ingeniously engineered to
operate efficiently, utilizing minimal resources such as electricity,
water, and ensuring a significant reduction in food waste. AstroChef
autonomously manages the entire cooking process from Start to
Finish, eliminating the need for human intervention. Our
ambitious vision for AstroChef extends beyond Earth, with the
aspiration to one day see it in action in outer space, specifically in
the Mars Colonies. This passion and dream of ours drives our
innovation in creating a technology that is not only versatile and
adaptable but also sustainable and forward-thinking, pushing the
boundaries of culinary innovation beyond Earth's confines.
This machine, with a comparable size to a double oven, incorporates
five foundational technologies that synergistically produce exceptional culinary outcomes.

Core Technologies:
1. AI Chef: The ingenious AI Chef utilizes decision based AI Technology to ensure consistent
taste and quality in every dish. It autonomously adjusts the composition of food ingredients to
accommodate specific dietary needs. Additionally, it recommends menu recipes based on the
availability of ingredients, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing food waste.
2. 3D Chopper: The remarkable 3D Chopper showcases its precision and dexterity in
meticulously cutting food ingredients in three dimensions. Equipped with self-sharpening
capabilities, this cutting-edge tool performs its task seamlessly, and designed to work even in
zero-gravity environments, expanding the possibilities of food preparation.
2

3. 360 Heating: The revolutionary 360 Heating technology employs electricity to cook food
evenly and efficiently at 360 degrees. By utilizing this method, AstroChef maximizes the
retention of food nutrients while reducing carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to
conventional gas-based cooking processes. This not only contributes to environmental
sustainability but also results in energy savings and shorter cooking times.
4. PDS: The ingenious Precise Delivery System (PDS) ensures that seasonings and sauces are
dispensed in precise amounts, guaranteeing well-balanced flavours in every dish. This system
allows for customization, catering to diverse preferences such as desired spice levels or low
sodium requirements for individuals with conditions like diabetes.
5. Fused Cleaning: The advanced Fused Cleaning technology takes responsibility for maintaining
impeccable hygiene standards. After each meal preparation, AstroChef employs a sanitizing
method that minimizes water usage while effectively cleaning the entire machine, ensuring a
high level of cleanliness.
Together, these five core technologies form the foundation of AstroChef and enable a complete
independent autonomous food preparation, from chopping to cleaning. These innovations set new
standards in culinary automation, efficiency, and sustainability, reducing both energy and water
bills, minimizing food waste, and lowering carbon emissions. The result is a cost-effective and
nutrient-rich food from GI Healthcare Kitchens.

AstroChef Salamouny:
Our latest version of AstroChef, the Salamouny, has undergone
over a year of R&D and can now autonomously cook multiple
cuisines. It is currently trained to cook five recipes and can
learn a new recipe in just two hours. Our upcoming model, the
AstroChef Addas, will feature an advanced AI Chef that can
generate recipes from the internet and cook any machine
compatible recipes without manual training process. With this
AI, the machine can quickly train thousands of recipes, which
will be carefully tasted and approved by our team. The
machine's hardware design enables the autonomous cooking of
all types of recipes traditionally prepared using a saucepan /
pot, and wok.

3

Moreover, AstroChef's manufacturing cost is significantly lower compared to other Food Industry
Robots that utilize Robotic Arms and exceed £150,000 in manufacturing expenses. AstroChef's
innovative design eliminates the requirement for robotic arms while offering greater autonomy to
cook different types of recipes than its industry counterparts. To manufacture this machine, we have
cultivated partnerships with reliable suppliers. We acquire Actuators from USA, Electronic parts
from China, and SS316 Stainless steel and Aluminium extrusion metal parts from India. The
combined cost of components for manufacturing an AstroChef amounts to approximately £6,000.

NutriChef:
NutriChef is GI Healthcare's innovative Kitchen Solution, a deployable robotic kitchen powered by
AstroChef machines. NutriChef is built using repurposed shipping containers, transforming them
into a fully functional culinary spaces that can be rapidly deployed to meet any high-demand areas
and start serving nutritious food promptly.

NutriChef Kitchen

The compact size of AstroChef machines enables a single large 40ft shipping container kitchen to
accommodate approximately, up to 20 machines, capable of serving an astounding 240 unique
individual recipes per hour. With this mobility and scalability, GI Healthcare ensures that
healthy and affordable food is accessible to anyone, anytime, and anywhere! In terms of cost, a 12ft
repurposed shipping container with flooring, plumbing, and wiring facilities is available in the [11]
UK market for approximately £5,000. For a little larger size kitchen spanning 20ft, the maximum
cost of that container is currently around £12,000. This cost-effective approach to kitchen
manufacturing allows for easy scalability and adaptability, as the interior design can accommodate
the integration of AstroChef. Additionally, the construction of a new kitchen can be completed
within days, enabling swift manufacturing and deployment in new cities.
The below table offers a comprehensive comparison between NutriChef Kitchen and a Typical
restaurant, highlighting NutriChef's superior advantages in cost reduction, flexibility, and
adaptability.

Flexibility

Deployable nature allows it to be quickly set
up in high-demand areas or areas with
limited culinary infrastructure. It can cater to
various locations and events such as festivals
or event natural disaster reliefs, providing
access to healthy food even in remote or
under served areas by using solar panels as
power source.

maintenance, rent, labour charges and
utilities. It offers a more affordable solution
for providing nutritious meals without
compromising on quality.

High overhead costs due to physical
location, staffing, and equipment expenses.

Labour
& Menu

Utilization of AstroChef Machines eliminates
the necessity for skilled labor, enabling the
entire kitchen to be operated by a single staff
member with a minimal training requirement.
Additionally, these machines are capable of
offering a wide range of recipes in various
cuisines.

On the other hand, a typical restaurant relies
on skilled chefs to operate, which increases
the operating cost and can be limiting in
terms of menu options due to the chef's
individual creativity and expertise.

Menu Price

By utilizing AstroChef machines, the cost of
a high-quality and healthy food menu is
significantly reduced by eliminating the need
for a professional chef and reducing
overhead costs such as electricity, water, and
inventory stock bills.

Reducing menu prices in a typical
restaurant is highly challenging due to the
significant portion of food costs attributed
to professional chefs (40%-70%).
Additionally, expenses such as gas bills
further contribute to the overall recipe costs.

Scalability

NutriChef Kitchen can be easily scaled up by
adding more machines in shipping container
kitchens. This scalability allows for a
significant increase in the number of recipes
and meals served, making it suitable for
large-scale operations or events. Moreover,
the kitchen's design & business model
facilitates easy expansion to open in new
branches in different locations with minimal
investment and operational requirements.

Scaling a typical restaurant involves
substantial investments in constructing new
spaces to accommodate additional kitchen
equipment, as well as purchasing new
equipment and hiring more chefs to handle
the expansion. This process makes it
challenging to open in new locations and
expand sales and brand recognition worldwide.

NutriChef's versatile design, combined with
integrated data analytics, allows it to swiftly
adapt to evolving market trends and customer
preferences. This makes it capable of
Adaptability accommodating a diverse range of recipes
and cuisines, providing a broad menu that
caters to various dietary needs and
preferences.

Incorporating new recipes or replacing
existing ones in a traditional restaurant
would necessitate extensive chef training.
Moreover, without access to data analytics
tools, these restaurants would face
challenges in promptly identifying market
trends.

we can freshly batch-cook meals on a daily basis, ensuring minimal waste and maximum utilization.
The detailed table provided offers a comprehensive breakdown of the expenses involved in
preparing a 20-serving NutriGo meal, specifically focusing on a lunch option: Rice with a healthy
Red bean curry, recommended by the UK Government as one of the essential 5-a-day foods. This
nutritious meal is priced at £1.60 per serving, and after factoring in all the costs associated with its
preparation, we achieve a gross profit of £1 per serving. This profit contributes to covering
additional expenses and ultimately leads to a profitable net profit.

FreshUp - (Starts at £3.50/full meal)
The FreshUp menu revolutionizes the dining experience by offering customers the ability to order
personalized food cooked on the spot using AstroChef machines. FreshUp introduces a
groundbreaking menu option that caters to customers' dietary needs and taste preferences with
freshly cooked meals. With prices ranging from £3.50 to £8.50 per meal, this innovative offering
ensures affordability without compromising on quality. Notably, the meals are prepared within a
mere 5 minutes, providing a quick and convenient solution for those seeking nutritious and
customized dining experiences. With the help of AstroChef machines, customers can now enjoy a
diverse selection of healthy cuisine options and tailor their meals like never before, surpassing the
possibilities offered by traditional restaurants.

GI Healthcare is able to provide personalized healthy food at an unprecedented price point by
utilizing autonomous technology and eliminating the need for highly skilled labour which
traditionally accounts for 40% to 70% of a meal's expense. In NutriChef Kitchens, operations will
be handled by a single trained staff member who will assist the machine in ingredient addition,
hygiene maintenance, and serving hot food to customers. Convenient options are available for
customers to either pick up their orders directly from the kitchen or have them delivered to their
location through our partnerships with popular services like Just Eat, Uber Eats, and Deliveroo. The
combination of our competitive pricing and the unparalleled convenience we offer sets our healthy
food apart from the rest, making it a unique and compelling proposition in the market. At GI
Healthcare, we are committed to redefining the way people access and enjoy nutritious meals,
ensuring that healthy eating becomes a convenient, time-saving and affordable lifestyle choice for
all.

Business Modelg
GI Healthcare makes revenue by providing healthy food through two distinct business models:
1. PAYG:
With our Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model, customers have the flexibility to order their favourite
meal and make an immediate payment. This option is ideal for first-time customers or those seeking
a quick and convenient single meal. In addition, this model will be employed in our Dark kitchen
setup, allowing customers to easily purchase and have their meals delivered through our partnered
food delivery services.
2. Subscription:
At our Kitchen, we aim to make healthy food accessible, convenient, and affordable, encouraging
customers to choose a wholesome diet on a daily basis. Through our monthly Subscription model,
customers receive two credits per day. These credits can be utilized to select any food items for
brunch, and dinner. Any unused credits will be carried forward to the next day. This model not only
promotes repeat customers and loyalty but also helps us manage stock effectively and reduce food
waste. Initially, we will implement a simple paper-based system during the pilot phase. However, as
we progress, we will develop our own website and app, providing customers with a digital version
of the subscription plan for ease of use.

their desired meals in advance using the FreshUp menu option or make on-the-spot selections from
the NutriGo Menu. Moreover, if certain meal options are priced higher than others, customers have
the flexibility to spare an extra credit, enabling them to enjoy the specific meal they desire on any
given day. This cost-effective subscription model, priced even lower than the [12] average student's
weekly food expenses, not only provides customers with fresh and nutritious meals but also
prioritizes convenience. In comparison to the existing ready-meal kit options available at higher
price points, our subscription offers a more affordable and accessible solution. By providing this
enticing combination, we establish a strong connection with our customers, encouraging them to
remain loyal to our restaurant while simultaneously supporting their health and convenience needs.
In the future, our expansion plan includes franchising our kitchen after 5 years. We will achieve this
by licensing our technology, kitchen equipment, and brand offerings to franchisees. This strategic
move will generate revenue for us through a 15% per-order fee, while the remaining profit will go
to the franchisees.

Customersg
GI Healthcare's target audience consists of individuals from diverse age groups with moderate
incomes, who prioritize their health and seek convenient, fresh, and affordable healthy food
options on a Daily Basis. Our research conducted among students, staff members at UWE Campus,
and the elderly residents of Stoke Gifford Retirement Home in Bristol has yielded overwhelmingly
positive feedback. In fact, 97% of the respondents expressed a strong desire for affordable healthy
food that offers a wide selection of recipes from different cuisines. This feedback underscores the
significant demand for our services, highlighting the need for accessible and customizable nutritious
meals.

Consumers:
Students
Disturbingly, a recent survey by the [13] NUS revealed that 92% of higher education students are
experiencing mental health issues due to this crisis, with rising costs significantly impacting their
well-being. Research conducted for the [14] Sutton Trust found that nearly a quarter of the
interviewed UK students reported that financial pressures were hindering their ability to complete
their degree, while 1 in 3 from working-class backgrounds stated they were reducing food intake to
save money. Additionally, 14% of students dislike cooking [15] and rely on takeaways. Our survey
conducted at UWE indicated that 1 in 20 British students are supported by parents who subscribe to
meal-kit food delivery services like HelloFresh. However, due to time constraints, students often
struggle to prepare & cook meals from meal kits and end up wasting the nutritious food ingredients
from these meal kits. GI Healthcare recognizes this as an opportunity to serve students and has
assessed the demand through their survey, with over 95.6% of UWE students expressing readiness
to purchase healthy food if offered at an affordable price.

Professionals
In 2020, a substantial 62% of Britons [16] made a conscious decision to improve their diet by opting
for healthier food choices, and 40.42% of the [17] UK population follows a healthy diet. Sales of
healthy food have grown [18] by over 30% in the past five years, reaching over £3 Billion in 2021.
Additionally, there is a [19] growing trend towards vegan food, with over 7.2 million vegans in the
UK. However, meeting a healthy diet poses a significant financial burden [20] for the poorest half of
households in the UK, requiring them to allocate nearly 30% of their disposable income. In contrast,
the richest half of households only need to allocate an average of 12% to meet the same
recommendations. During our survey at UWE, staff members identified a 97.3% demand for
affordable healthy food among this demographic group.

Elderly
According to a poll by Care UK, [54] nearly one-third of older people in the UK are unable to use
their kitchens safely. Furthermore, 93% of elderly individuals in the UK [6] who suffer from
malnutrition live in care homes or retirement villages. During our research at Stoke Gifford
Retirement Village, although they have caretakers, the meals that the elderly receive often do not
cater to their personal nutritional requirements, with sandwiches being the most a caretaker can
prepare. Additionally, ready meals for the elderly, such as the Meals-on-Wheels service, lack dietary
10

personalization. This has created a need for greater personalization and convenience in the elderly
market. Our survey based research found highest need in this demographic, i.e. - 98.1%
NutriChef offers freshly cooked, healthy food at an affordable price while allowing for greater
dietary personalization. Through this technology, our aim is to support and cater to the diverse
needs of all customer groups. We plan to make healthy food more accessible through the Dark
kitchen model, where customers can order and customize their meals for delivery or pick-up.
Furthermore, for students, working professionals, and the elderly, we intend to bring healthy food
even closer with less carbon footprint by placing our NutriChef kitchens within private institutions
sites such as universities, office buildings, food banks and retirement villages.

Franchisee:
In future, after operating successfully for 5-years, we plan to Franchise the NutriChef. Our
customers (Franchisee) are Entrepreneurs who are looking to start a restaurant buying and looking
for cheap and best solutions and/or people who want to bring healthy food solutions to their
community and help the community get healthy food. In the UK alone 18% of 1.3 million Britons
[21] who dream to start a business want to start a food business, globally this number is high. And
we plan to expand by franchising to private institutions as well and their market data is explained
below in the market section.

Executiong
After extensive research and development spanning over a year, GI Healthcare has successfully
developed the latest version AstroChef Salamouny, a functional and food-safe machine capable of
cooking delicious food. Working closely with the UWE Food & Hygiene department, we have
ensured that our latest version meets the highest standards. Our next step is to establish our first
NutriChef Pilot kitchen, in order to operate our kitchen, we first must obtain the necessary licenses
and certifications. Here is an overview of the progress GI Healthcare has made:
Licenses and Certifications Already Obtained:
• Insurance: We have secured public and employer liability insurance, providing coverage of up to
£10 million.
• Electrical Testing: Our machines have undergone PAT testing for electrical safety, facilitated by
our location at the Bristol Robotics Lab (BRL) Incubator. We will also obtain BRL's Technician
approval for all other machines used in our kitchen. Additionally, our NutriChef kitchen will
undergo an Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR).
Licenses and Certifications in Progress:
• Food Business Registration: [22] Before opening our restaurant, we are in the process of
completing the necessary registration with the South Gloucestershire Council. This entails a
thorough assessment of our equipment, fire safety measures, risk register, and hygiene ratings.
• Energy Labeling (EPREL): Our kitchen will receive energy labelling from certified agencies
[24] to demonstrate our operational energy efficiency level.
11

• NSF Certificate: We are actively working towards obtaining an [23] NSF certificate for
AstroChef, validating its ability to operate at high temperatures and effectively eliminate 99.999%
of bacteria.
Licenses and Certifications Not Required at This Stage:
• Food Premise License: Initially, as we will exclusively prepare vegetarian food, a Food Premise
License is [26] not necessary. Even in the later stages, it is not required since it pertains to
businesses supplying food of animal origin to other businesses. As we directly sell to consumers,
this license is not needed.
• UKCA and CE Certificates: Since we are not engaged in [25] commercial sales of our machines,
obtaining UKCA or CE certificates is not mandatory.
• Alcohol and Music Licenses: Since we will not be serving alcoholic beverages or employing a
music system in our kitchen, we are exempt from acquiring any [26] premise licenses or PPL PRS
Music License in the UK.

Roadmap:
During the regulatory process period, GI Healthcare will conduct a comprehensive survey within
the UWE Community to identify the most in-demand recipes and train our machines accordingly.
Further, our roadmap is as follows,

Pilot Kitchen at UWE

Establish 3 NutriChef Kitchens

Establish 10 NutriChef Kitchens

Bootstrap:
Upon successfully obtaining all the required regulatory licenses, we have set our sights on
launching our Bootstrap kitchen operations in October 2023. This innovative kitchen will be housed
within a 12ft shipping container, equipped with three latest AstroChef Salamouny machines. Our
machines will undergo thorough training to master the preparation of up to 50 distinct recipes
spanning various cuisines. To ensure seamless operations, one of our skilled team members will
oversee the kitchen's day-to-day activities and assists the machines.
12

The primary objective of this pilot kitchen is to gather valuable feedback from our esteemed
customers. By actively engaging with paying customers, we aim to gauge market demand and refine
our operational processes based on their invaluable input. This iterative approach will enable us to
continuously enhance the kitchen's performance and exceed customer expectations.
Furthermore, the positive response and growing sales demand generated during this pilot phase will
serve as compelling evidence to present to potential seed investors. By demonstrating the viability
and success of our concept, we aim to secure the seed investment to establish 3 additional kitchens
by 2024. It is our ambition to execute this Bootstrap program for a duration of six months and raise
the seed investment by the first quarter of 2024.
Year 2 & 3:
Building upon the success of our initial seed investment, our focus shifts towards establishing three
additional kitchens within Bristol City. Our strategic plan involves enhancing the existing shipping
container kitchen at UWE Bristol and introducing a Dark kitchen that operates through an online
food delivery platform, as well as offering economic pick-up services. This Dark kitchen will be
strategically placed in the bustling Bristol city centre, catering to the busy community of working
professionals and students residing in that area. The flexibility of our Dark kitchen also allows us to
easily relocate it to high-demand locations and prominent events, including the renowned
Glastonbury music festival, where we can serve large crowds and increase brand visibility.
Moreover, based on the insights gained from our bootstrap project and the specific needs of the
elderly, we have envisioned deploying our third NutriChef kitchen at Stoke Gifford Village
Retirement Home. This dedicated kitchen will serve as a research kitchen facility, enabling us to
gather feedback from paying elderly customers and enhance AstroChef's performance to
specifically cater to the dietary preferences of the elderly. Our ultimate aim is to develop a robust
version of AstroChef that is tailored to meet the unique needs of the elderly community. This
research will play a vital role in improving and establishing specialized catering services for the
elderly as part of our future expansion plans.
Over the course of these two years, our primary objective is to generate substantial revenue and
establish a profitable, self-sustaining business model by the end of Year 3. By leveraging the power
of data analytics, we will analyze customer preferences, identify the most popular recipes in
different locations, and continuously refine our offerings to enhance customer satisfaction.
Additionally, these two years will provide us with invaluable operational experience, enabling us to
effectively scale our operations and solidify our position in the market.
Year 4 & 5:
Looking ahead, our strategic vision encompasses raising Angel investment by Q1 2026. This
infusion of capital will enable us to expand our footprint, establishing additional kitchens in various
UK cities. With our sights set on global expansion, we plan to franchise our successful kitchen
model after five years of operation, extending our reach to international markets.

13

By adhering to this comprehensive roadmap, we are confident in our ability to achieve sustainable
growth, revolutionize the food industry, and make healthy and affordable food accessible to a wider
audience.

Bootstrap Executive strategy:

The NutriChef Bootstrap Kitchen will undergo its pilot phase at the University of West England
(UWE), Frenchay Campus, where our current office is based. We have strategically selected this
site due to its diverse demographic, encompassing students, staff, and elderly individuals in one
central location. The campus boasts a [27] student population of over 30,000, along with
approximately 2,500 student tenants residing in on-campus accommodation. Moreover, the campus
brings over 3,000 UWE staff members and entrepreneurs who are frequent on weekdays.
Adjacent to the campus resides the Stoke Gifford Village Retirement Home, managed by the
ExtraCare Organisation, housing more than 300 elderly residents [28]. This proximity provides us
with an excellent opportunity to commence the pilot phase and serve customers across various age
groups. Additionally, this location has been strategically chosen as it will serve as a base for three
additional kitchens following the pilot. The pilot phase will provide us with valuable operational
experience in catering to students, and elderly individuals, and even catering for UWE student
union events. This experience will be crucial in preparing us for future kitchen placements.

Premise:
Manufacturing:
GI Healthcare has been offered a free place at the Bristol
Robotics Lab Incubator since Sept 2022, this incubator provides
us with a workshop area to manufacture and test our AstroChef
Machines. This incubator also offers technician support for
building and manufacturing robotic hardware. In the initial year,
we will utilize this space for research and development purposes
and for manufacturing a limited quantity of AstroChef machines
for the pilot kitchen. Subsequently, we will relocate to our own
office space in Future Space Bristol, where we have already
received preliminary support. For the next five years, our plan is
to source all the components from our trusted suppliers in
different countries and perform the assembly of these
components at our dedicated office space.
Meeting Rooms:
Our headquarters is located in the UWE Student
Ventures building, where we have registered our
business since May 2021. This space is provided
to UWE graduates free of charge and includes a
meeting room. It will serve as our temporary
location for another year, after which we will
have our dedicated meeting rooms in Future
Space. Additionally, we currently benefit from
pro bono support from Setsquared Incubator
Bristol until June 2023. Our plan is to transition
to a paid membership to avail of their assistance
in scaling our business, which will also grant us
access to additional meeting room spaces.
Kitchen Space:
For the bootstrap phase, we intend to position our shipping container kitchen in the UWE Car
parking space near the business block where we have
access to electricity, and is also strategically located at the
heart of the campus with excellent visibility and
NutriChef
accessibility. Given its mobility feature, we also plan to
relocate it within the campus as needed. We are currently
in the process of securing this space from the UWE
Director of Estates, who shares the vision of providing
healthy food to his students and is willing to offer us a
space, either free or for a fee, for the pilot phase. Once
15

the pilot is successful, and as we establish the three new kitchens, we will secure a designated space
at UWE for one of the kitchens, where we will pay rent. In collaboration with ExtraCare Org, the
retirement home kitchen will occupy a rental space if there is sufficient demand during the pilot.
Lastly, we aim to obtain permission from the Bristol council to set up our Dark kitchen in Bristol
City Centre. This mobile kitchen will also be utilized at festivals, subject to the approval of festival
organizations such as Glastonbury Festival Ltd.

Supply Chain:
Initially, we will forge strategic partnerships with local greengrocers at the esteemed Bristol
Farmers Market to source the finest and freshest ingredients for our kitchen. This collaborative
approach empowers us to leverage the benefits of purchasing in large quantities, thereby securing
more advantageous pricing. Moreover, our trusted greengrocer partners offer the convenience of
direct delivery to our kitchen, streamlining the logistics involved. As we embark on expanding our
operations to other cities, we will diligently uphold these invaluable relationships with local
suppliers, ensuring an unwavering and dependable supply of top-quality, fresh produce. In addition,
our AstroChef parts suppliers rely on trusted logistics delivery systems such as FedEx and DHL to
safely and efficiently transport the valuable components to our UK office. We have successfully
received all the necessary parts for our current AstroChef versions within a timeframe of two weeks.

Marketingg
Buddy Scheme:
To generate word-of-mouth buzz and attract a growing customer base, we have implemented our
innovative Buddy Scheme. Under this scheme, we offer complimentary meals to individuals who
refer new customers to our kitchen. It serves as a rewarding incentive for our loyal patrons while
expanding our reach through their recommendations.
Loyalty & Discounts:
In our commitment to fostering customer loyalty, we will introduce exclusive loyalty cards with
enticing discounts. These cards incentivize repeat visits and encourage customers to choose our
wholesome and affordable healthy food options.
Social Media:
To engage our target audience effectively, we will launch an Instagram account targeting individuals
aged 18 to 35, along with a Facebook presence catering to those aged 35 and above. Through these
platforms, we will share captivating articles and videos that promote the numerous benefits of
healthy eating. As we expand globally, we have plans to collaborate with influential social media
figures who champion the cause of healthy food.

16

Dark Kitchen Ads:
For our Dark kitchens operating on online food delivery platforms, we will employ strategic
advertising techniques. We will offer attractive discounts and promotions through the delivery
platform apps, ensuring our kitchen stands out among the competition and captures the attention of
potential customers.
Colour Scheme:
In line with our branding strategy, we have chosen a vibrant red colour as our signature hue. This
deliberate selection aims to instantly captivate customers, as red holds psychological appeal and
makes our brand visible and distinctive. Not only will our kitchen feature this eye-catching colour
scheme, but our AstroChef machines will also be painted in red, further emphasizing our unique
identity.
Surveys:
When launching in new locations, we will proactively gather valuable customer insights through
surveys. By requesting customers to participate and share their preferences, we can customize our
menu offerings to suit local tastes. As an expression of gratitude, we will reward survey participants
with complimentary credits on their loyalty cards, allowing them to enjoy a free meal during their
next visit.
Attractive Menu:
Our menu offers customers a comprehensive view of each meal's nutritional value, conveniently
categorized into sections such as sports, energy, brain, heart, sleep, and more. This allows customers
to not only select recipes based on their taste preferences but also consider the specific nutritional
benefits.
Chef Collaboration:
As part of our future plans, we envision a strategic collaboration with renowned chefs such as
Gordon Ramsay or Jamie Oliver to develop exclusive and exceptional recipes specifically tailored
for our machines. This collaboration will serve as a powerful marketing tool to showcase the
outstanding taste and quality that our machines can deliver. By partnering with these esteemed
chefs, we aim to leverage their expertise and reputation to further promote our brand and attract a
wider audience. Through this exciting collaboration, we aspire to elevate the culinary experience for
our customers and solidify our position as a leader in the industry.

Marketg
Dark Kitchen Market:
Currently, a significant 70% of the global population [29] prefers the convenience of online food
delivery platforms, and this number is projected to reach 2.6 billion users worldwide by 2026. In the
UK alone, there are already [30] over 750 Dark Kitchens, with a market size of £4.9 billion, and this
industry is expected to grow even faster. Given the demand for healthy and affordable food options
in the UK, we anticipate achieving over £1 million in Gross Revenue by the end of Year 3. Globally,
the Dark kitchen market [31] is one of the fastest-growing sectors, predicted to reach a value of $373
billion by 2030, with an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%. Countries such
as the US, India, China, the UK, and UAE are among the top markets in this industry. After
establishing our successful presence in the UK, our plan is to expand globally, starting with the US
and UAE, where there is a high demand for healthy and affordable food options.

US Market:
According to data shared by the researcher [32] Eddie Yoon in Harvard Business Review, nearly
90% of Americans do not enjoy cooking. While 93% of Americans express a desire to [33] eat
healthily, only 10% say they always eat healthy due to affordability factors. Currently, 18 million
people in the US [34] lack access to affordable healthy food. This demand for affordable and
nutritious meals presents us with an advantageous opportunity to scale our operations in this
country.
UAE Market:
A recent study conducted by a leading consulting firm [35] revealed that 55% of people in the UAE
who order food online prioritize healthy options. The current market size for healthy food delivery
in the UAE exceeds $1 billion. The UAE government has also been actively promoting healthy
eating through its [36] SEHHI Program. These factors indicate a significant demand for launching
our kitchen in the UAE. Furthermore, 81% of the [37] UAE population desires healthy food options
from vending machines, which presents us with a new market opportunity.

Private Institutional Kitchen:
The global catering market currently has a [39] value of $154.4 billion, with the UK alone
accounting for $4.4 billion [38]. We intend to enter the private institutional catering market through
a franchising business model, serving customers in elderly communities, universities, schools,
offices, and more.
Universities:
In Year 4, we plan to expand into private institutions by establishing NutriChef kitchens within
universities. Currently, there are 160 universities [40] in the UK, with 2.8 million students studying
[41] and living there. Additionally, as we scale up in the US and UAE, the [42] US has 4,000
18

universities [43] with a staggering number of 19.4 million students. Similarly, in the UAE, [44] there
are 100 universities with 140,000 students residing and studying there.
Elderly:
The global elderly food and nutrition market [45] is projected to reach $30.64 billion by 2030. In the
UK alone, the number of people over 60 years old [46] is expected to reach 15.1 million by 2025,
accounting for 23% of the total UK population. Currently, there are 17 retirement villages
throughout the UK, [47] housing 70,000 residents, and [48] 17,100 care homes. By conducting
thorough R&D in Years 2 & 3 from the third kitchen at Stoke Gifford Retirement Home, our aim is
to develop a robust version of our AstroChef technology specifically tailored to meet the dietary
needs of the elderly and capture this growing market segment. Additionally, after successfully
expanding in the UK elderly market, our next plan is to scale our operations in the US. The US is
home to [49] the world's largest retirement community villages and [50] has 56 million elderly’s,
accounting for 16.9% of the total population. A significant portion of senior citizens resides in
California, a state known for its large technology companies, making it an ideal starting point for
our expansion.
Currently, the Dark Kitchen market in the EU is slow, and we will further assess in the future
whether to enter this market or not. However, the market for private institutional kitchens,
especially for the elderly, looks promising. The [51] elderly population is projected to reach 48.4
Million by 2025. We will continue to assess technology adaptation and cultural factors before
launching into the EU market.
Furthermore, we have plans to scale our Dark Kitchen operations in India and China, two countries
with rapidly growing markets. In India, the Dark Kitchen market, also known as the cloud kitchen
market, [52] is projected to reach a size of 1.9 billion by 2026. Similarly, China is expected [53] to
have a market size of $24.31 billion by the same year. These markets offer significant opportunities
for expansion. However, we recognize the importance of carefully assessing the cultural and
geopolitical factors before entering these markets. Our strategy involves launching our kitchens in
these countries through a franchise model, allowing us to navigate local nuances effectively and
ensure a successful entry into these promising markets. Based on our initial research, we have
determined that the Private Institutional Kitchen model may not be suitable for implementation in
India. Factors such as limited facilities and inexpensive labour, as well as the traditional eating
culture prevalent in the country, make it less conducive for this particular concept. On the other
hand, China presents a promising opportunity for us to establish our presence in both the Dark
Kitchen and Private Institutional Kitchen markets. The country's advanced infrastructure facilities
and high level of technological adoption, particularly in the realm of robotics, make it an ideal
environment for our operations. China's progressive approach to restaurant automation aligns well
with our goals, further supporting our decision to focus on this market for future expansion.
Lastly, thanks to the flexibility of our kitchen, which allows it to be deployed and operated in any
location, we can collaborate with the UN and other government sectors to provide assistance in
disaster relief and other rapid response situations.

Competitiong
Price & Health
In the UK, there is a wide selection of healthy food restaurants available, including Ethos, Kitch,
Natural Chinese, Dough, the Gardener Cottage, and The Good Life Eatery. However, their higher
price points (above ££) make it financially challenging to afford their meals on a daily basis.
Another option is ready meals delivered for a week from companies like Field Doctor, All Plants,
and Fuel Hub. While convenient, these meals come at an average price range of £8 - £9 per serving.
Alternatively, there are more affordable options like veg boxes delivered to homes from companies
like Hello Fresh and Gusto, but these require additional effort from users to cook the food, lacking
the desired convenience. Fast-food chains like McDonald's, Greggs, and KFC offer affordable
options, but they prioritize convenience over health. The table provided below offers a
comprehensive comparison of NutriChef with other food companies, considering factors such as
affordability, the freshness of food, personalization of dietary and taste preferences, healthiness
options, and convenience. The price listed for each brand represents the average cost per serving/
meal, determined through a thorough analysis of their menus and recipes. Please keep in mind that
prices may vary depending on the location & time.

Robotics:
In the food automation industry, several companies compete, but their technology is often expensive
and lacks versatility. For example, Miso's Flippy Robot and Karakuri robots use robotic arms for
cooking, costing over £250k, and can only perform limited tasks like frying chips or reheating precooked food. Other companies such as Aitme, Kitchen Robotics, and RoboChef have developed
large machines that are difficult to integrate into existing kitchens and sell through a RAAS (Robotas-a-Service) business model, which still doesn’t allow restaurant owners to reduce the price of a
meal.

21

NutriChef's USP
Health & Affordability:
In contrast to the competition, NutriChef offers an unparalleled value proposition. It combines
affordability, convenience, and healthy food options, and offers a highly competitive advantage,
setting it apart from expensive restaurants and premium meal delivery services. NutriChef provides
affordable meals without compromising on quality or nutrition, making it suitable for individuals
even with modest incomes. The autonomous cooking technology employed by NutriChef eliminates
the need for highly skilled labour, reducing overall costs while maintaining the nutritional value and
taste of the dishes. This ensures that fresh and healthy meals are accessible and convenient for
customers to buy on a Daily Basis.
Technology advantage:
The design and technology of NutriChef's kitchen allow for flexibility, mobility, and easy
deployment, making it more cost-effective compared to other automation competitors. For example,
even the smallest NutriChef kitchen, housed in a 12ft shipping container and equipped with three
AstroChef machines, costs less than £30k and can efficiently process multiple orders per hour,
accommodating various cuisines and recipes.

Service:
Moreover, AstroChef machines can be installed or removed in minutes without disrupting kitchen
operations, unlike competitors such as Spyce Robotics and Kitchen Robotics, which may require
days for equipment replacement or servicing which disrupts sales.

22

Sustainability:
AstroChef's groundbreaking space technology development enables a significant reduction in food
waste and resource consumption, exemplifying its unwavering commitment to sustainability and
responsible practices.
In summary, NutriChef's unique combination of affordability, convenience, healthy food options,
and advanced autonomous cooking technology sets it apart from the competition. Its ability to
easily scale globally is facilitated by its cost-effective and versatile design, making it accessible for
individuals seeking nutritious meals on a daily basis.

Intellectual Propertyg
Trademark:
In the first year, GI Healthcare Industries Limited will secure the trademarks for NutriChef and
AstroChef as brand names, safeguarding them against any unauthorized use or imitation.
Design Patents:
By the second year, we will obtain design patents to protect the unique designs of AstroChef
machines and the technological interiors of NutriChef kitchens from replication or infringement.
Technology Patents:
During the Bootstrap project, AstroChef's interior technologies will remain undisclosed to the
public, and accessible only within our private operations. Hence, patents are not required at this
early stage and everything is currently covered with NDA for outside visitors. However, starting in
the second year, we will begin patenting AstroChef's technologies to explore new markets by
licensing the technology for applications in the food industry, healthcare, and more. This strategic
move will generate additional revenue and also pave the way for franchising NutriChef and
expanding globally.
Currently, GI Healthcare is receiving support from Innovate UKRI Edge, and we have been
awarded to receive a grant of £3000 funding from the UK IPO office for the initial IP Audit
process. This support will further enable us to secure an additional £5000 in funding from the IPO
office to patent our first technology in the UK. These intellectual property protections will not only
safeguard our technology and designs but also enhance the company's valuation, making it more
appealing to potential investors.

23

Financial Forecastg
GI Healthcare operates on a financial year that runs from May to April. The following financial
forecast covers the next five years, providing a detailed overview of the project's viability and
scalability.

Sales Forecast:

The sales forecast considers both the NutriGo menu option and the FreshUp menu option,
projecting the number of sales per day in a given month. Sales are expected to commence in
October 2023, with the start of our Bootstrap project. The forecast demonstrates a monthly increase
in sales as we promote our kitchen and brand through marketing efforts. Based on the current
performance of the UWE One Zone Kitchen, which processes over 700 orders per day, we have
extrapolated our sales projections. Additionally, it is worth noting that in order for a restaurant to
sustain its operations, it typically needs to serve at least 30 orders per hour. Our Kitchen, equipped
with three AstroChef machines, has the capacity to create up to 36 orders per hour. This highlights
the efficiency and capability of our kitchen setup to meet and exceed the demands of our customers.
Furthermore, an average restaurant located in a [55] high-demand area typically handles around 300
daily orders, considering both online and offline sales channels. These figures provide valuable
insights into our sales potential and market demand as we continue to grow and expand our
operations. In Year 2, as we establish three new kitchens (one each in Q1, Q2, and Q3), we
anticipate a boost in sales following each launch. We plan to continue operating this kitchen until
the end of Year 3 to gain operational experience and gather valuable data analytics. These insights
are crucial as we scale up in Year 4. From Year 4 onwards, we plan to launch two new kitchens
every quarter, resulting in a further increase in sales. The forecast accounts for the impact of
holidays and other events, providing a more realistic projection. Additionally, we anticipate that the
implementation of a subscription business model will contribute to an increase and retainment in
24

sales. It is important to note that the sales increase percentage will be over 100% in Year 2, as the
first year only includes a nine-month sales period with a single bootstrap kitchen.

Income Statement:

Revenue:
Based on the monthly sales numbers, the revenue for the NutriGo menu option is calculated by
multiplying the total number of NutriGo sales per year by the average order price (£3.5). Similarly,
the revenue for the FreshUp menu option is determined by multiplying the total number of FreshUp
sales per year by the average price (£5.5). The average price is assumed to increase each year in line
with a projected UK inflation rate of 10.4%. The total Gross Revenue is obtained by summing the
revenue from both NutriGo and the FreshUp menu option. The Net Revenue is then calculated by
deducting Discounts given for loyalty cards from the Gross Revenue. With the sales increase over
the years, we project a Net Revenue of over £1 Million by the end of year 3.

25

COGS Assumption:
The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is determined as a percentage of revenue, and the following
assumptions are made for each year:
1. Cost of Raw Materials: In a typical restaurant, the cost of raw materials per meal ranges from
30% to 40%. However, by directly sourcing raw materials from the farmer's market, we have
assumed it to be 35% per meal. We project this percentage to decrease to 32% as we improve our
sales efficiency and establish strong relationships with farmers.
2. Packaging Cost: The cost associated with packaging is accounted for under fulfilment. It is
estimated to be 3% in the first year and increases annually as we grow. This includes server costs,
packaging cost increments, and other related expenses.
3. Bank Transaction Fees: When using services like Stripe, the bank transaction fee is 2.9% for
sales under 1 million per year and 3.1% for sales exceeding 1 million orders.
4. Energy Cost: Energy cost is calculated as 2% of a meal, considering its efficiency. This
percentage decreases over time as we enhance the efficiency of our heating technology.
5. Rent: In the first year, with the bootstrap kitchen, rent is estimated to be approximately £1500 per
month. For the subsequent years, we estimate it to be £2000 per kitchen per month. This estimation
is adjusted based on the revenue percentage indicated in the rent assumption row.

26

Operating Expense:
Operating expenses, similar to the cost of goods sold (COGS), are determined as a percentage of
revenue. The marketing budget and research and development (R&D) costs are allocated on an
annual basis, based on this revenue percentage. As our business expands, our marketing budget in
Year 2 and Year 3 is primarily directed towards the second Cloud Kitchen. This is because our
kitchen is already well-established and recognized on the UWE campus and in the Elderly Home,
requiring less marketing expenditure for those locations. Therefore, we have allocated less than
£20,000 for Marketing in the second year. It is worth noting that in Year 3, the marketing budget is
lower than in Year 2. This is attributed to the fact that, after extensive marketing efforts in Year 2,
we have achieved a satisfactory level of repeat customers, thus reducing the need for further
marketing. Additionally, we allocate 5% of revenue for each year towards selling, general, and
administrative (SGA) expenses, as well as other miscellaneous costs.
Tax:
The Corporation Tax in the UK for a Limited Company is 25%. The R&D Tax return benefit is
13%, but we estimate that 3% of it will be charged by the accountant. Consequently, we anticipate a
10% return on R&D spending each year.
Staff Strategy:

At the outset of the pilot project, our core team consisting of the CEO, CTO, and Senior Robotics
Engineer will be the primary workforce. To ensure the startup's success, the team members will
draw minimal salaries. During this bootstrap phase, each member will take turns operating the
kitchen, with the CEO overseeing day-to-day activities and supply chain management. Currently,
we have the valuable support of UWE Law Clinic, which provides us with accounting assistance.
We have been fortunate to benefit from this free support, and we plan to continue utilizing their
services until the end of this year. However, as we progress into year 2, our intention is to hire a
27

professional accountant from a reputable accountancy firm. This step will ensure that we have
dedicated expertise in managing our finances, allowing us to make informed decisions and maintain
financial stability as we continue to grow our business.
In the second year, as we plan to scale our operations, we will hire additional employees to focus on
research and development (R&D) and dedicated kitchen operations. A Service Engineer will also be
brought on board to perform monthly maintenance and servicing of the AstroChef machines. To
maintain smooth operations, a Chief Operating Officer (COO) will join the core team to manage the
supply chain and team activities. Additionally, we will explore opportunities to collaborate with
universities and leverage their student internship schemes. This will not only bring new talent to the
team but also help reduce the overhead costs associated with hiring new staff. The staffing table
provided above displays the total number of employees and the corresponding staffing expenses,
which amount to £325,686. Additionally, an Employee National Insurance contribution of £35,238
is included in the overall staffing costs.
As we progress into the fourth year and expand further, our staffing will include a dedicated service
engineer team, kitchen operators, operational managers, and an expanded R&D team. This structure
will enable us to effectively manage operations, enhance customer service, and drive innovation. By
2027, we anticipate the creation of 48 new jobs within our organization. The wages of these
employees have been carefully calculated and incorporated into the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
section of the Income Statement.

Investments:

GI Healthcare secured its initial investment of £70,000 in Year One for the Bootstrap project
through funding from the Founder's Family in exchange for a 5% equity stake. Upon the successful
completion of the pilot and data collection phase, our objective is to secure an additional £350,000
in private equity funding, with the intention of finalizing the deal by the fourth quarter of Year One.
This investment will be utilized to construct and establish three kitchens during Year Two. Looking
ahead to Year Three, we have set our sights on raising £1.5 million through a combination of 80%
matched funding from Innovate UK Smart Grants or other IUK Grants, which will be dedicated to
research and development (R&D) initiatives aimed at further enhancing our kitchen technology.
This funding will pave the way for our expansion plans in Year Four. Beyond Year 5, our strategic
goal is to secure Series funding to facilitate the franchising and expansion of our business.

28

IP:
Furthermore, in Year 1, we have currently received £3000 from UK Gov IP Office for conducting
an IP Audit and currently in the process of completing before 14/07/2023, later that we will receive
an IP Access Grant of £5,000 as from the IPO Office to cover the costs associated with filing our
first patent. Subsequent intellectual property (IP) expenses will be accounted for within our R&D
expenditure. Once we file a Patent successfully, we aim to receive the Corporation Tax Relief on
profits through the Patent Box Scheme.
Owner’s Equity:
Over the past two years, the founder has made a total investment of £6,300 towards the R&D
process. These investments are reflected in the Historical year section of the balance sheet,
highlighting the founder's commitment to the company's growth.
Fixed Assets:

The majority of our fixed assets consist of shipping containers, AstroChef cooking machines, and
kitchen equipment. Additionally, each year GI Healthcare plans to allocate funds for purchasing
R&D equipment, including computers, 3D printers, laser cutters, machining tools, servers, and
more. As our revenue expands after year 5, we have strategic plans to acquire our own dedicated
R&D and manufacturing facility in the UK.
Debt:
We have a prudent approach to debt management and do not anticipate taking any loans for the next
three years. This decision aligns with our goal to minimize the need for repayment and maintain a
healthy financial position.
EBITDA:
A strong EBITDA margin of 10% and above is considered favourable for a restaurant business.
Initially, our company's EBITDA margin is negative in the first two years due to operational losses
as we establish and grow our business. However, after reaching the breakeven point around Year 3,
our EBITDA margin begins to improve, reflecting our progress towards profitability.
29

Breakeven Point:
Based on our financial projections, we anticipate reaching the breakeven point for our project
between the second and third years. The breakeven point is the stage at which our revenue equals
our expenses, indicating that we have covered all our costs and are starting to generate a profit. This
timeline indicates that we have carefully analyzed our financial forecasts and have set realistic
targets to ensure the project's financial sustainability.

30

Cash Balance:
Through strategic investments at the opportune moments and consistent revenue generation, we
effectively manage and maintain a sustainable cash balance each year. This approach ensures that
our company remains financially stable and capable of meeting its financial obligations and
pursuing growth opportunities in the coming years.

31

Exit Strategyg
GI Healthcare has conducted a thorough assessment of its exit strategy alternatives, prioritizing the
optimal outcome for the company and its stakeholders within a timeframe of 8-10 years. Over the
course of the subsequent 15 years, our objective is to secure a substantial 25% share of the Global
Catering Market, projecting an estimated annual Net Income of £2 Billion.
Primary Option:
The primary exit strategy is to take the company public through an initial public offering (IPO).
This approach would allow GI Healthcare to list its shares on a stock exchange and provide an
opportunity for investors to buy and sell shares in the company. Going public would not only
provide liquidity for existing shareholders but also enable the company to raise additional capital
for further growth and expansion. It would also enhance the company's visibility, credibility, and
access to a broader investor base.
Secondary Option:
In the event that going public is not the preferred route by future investors & stakeholders or market
conditions are not favourable, GI Healthcare’s secondary option is being acquired by larger
companies in the industry. Being acquired by a well-established player can provide significant
advantages in terms of financial resources, distribution networks, and market reach. Potential
companies that might be interested in acquiring GI Healthcare include major players in the food
automation and healthcare sectors. For example, companies like Amazon, Nestlé, and Sodexo could
be potential suitors due to their focus on technology, food services, and commitment to innovation.
These companies may see the value in acquiring GI Healthcare to strengthen their position in the
emerging market of autonomous cooking technology and healthy food services.
1. An acquisition by Amazon could bring synergies between GI Healthcare's technology and
Amazon's expertise in e-commerce and delivery services, allowing for further integration of
autonomous cooking in their offerings.
2. Compass Catering, a leader in catering and facility management, could benefit from GI
Healthcare's solutions in providing nutritious meals to its diverse range of clients, such as
universities, hospitals, and corporate offices.
3. Sodexo, another leader in catering and facility management, could benefit from GI Healthcare's
solutions in providing nutritious meals to its diverse range of clients including Defence, and
other private institutions such as universities, hospitals, and corporate offices.
Ultimately, the decision to go public or pursue an acquisition will depend on various factors,
including market conditions, the company's financial performance, and the goals of the
stakeholders. GI Healthcare will carefully evaluate these options to ensure a successful and
beneficial exit strategy that maximizes value for its shareholders and supports the continued growth
and impact of the company.

32

Risk Planningg
Like any other business, GI Healthcare faces various potential risks. The following table highlights
the top five risks along with their respective mitigation strategies:
Risk

Technology
Dependacy

E ects

Mitigation

The high level of reliance on
technology in our kitchen poses a risk
of potential failures due to machine
repairs, system downtime, or cyber
breaches, which could result in
disruptions or even closure.

To address this risk, we have implemented
AstroChef Technology, which is designed
for easy installation and removal to
minimize sales disruptions during machine
repairs or servicing. Additionally, in Year 2,
we will be hiring a team of skilled software
engineers who will be responsible for the
ongoing maintenance and security of our
servers, ensuring the continuity and
protection of our software systems.
1. To mitigate the risk of funding delays,
we have set a target to secure investments
well in advance of the start date for each
project. By proactively raising funds, we
aim to ensure that we have the necessary
resources available when needed.

There is a risk of potential delays in
executing our roadmap, which may be
caused by
Execution Delays

1. funding delays,
2. Technology readiness issues, and or
manufacturer supply chain delays.
3. Regulatory approval delays

2. To address potential technology and
supply chain delays, we have established
reliable manufacturing sources in countries
such as the US, China, and India. These
manufacturers are known for their
efficiency and quality. Moreover, we have
partnered with trusted and expedient
delivery services such as FedEx and DHL
to ensure timely deliveries of our
equipment and components.
3. In terms of regulatory delays, we are
committed to thorough preparation and
timely submission of all required
assessments and documentation. By
proactively engaging with regulatory
authorities and adhering to their guidelines,

Growth Potentialityg
Innovative:
• GI Healthcare’s vision is to make affordable healthy food accessible to anyone, anytime
anywhere. It’s Kitchen - NutriChef is a pioneering concept in the culinary industry, showcasing a
remarkable level of innovation. What sets NutriChef apart is its integration of advanced robotic
technology, revolutionizing the way meals are prepared and served. The autonomous deployable
kitchen eliminates the need for highly skilled chefs, making it accessible to a wider audience.
• At the heart of NutriChef lies AstroChef, an advanced autonomous cooking machine developed
by the founder. This core technology drives the kitchen's efficiency, significantly reducing
operational costs while maintaining exceptional food quality. By leveraging these cutting-edge
machines, NutriChef stands out by offering freshly cooked, healthy meals at an affordable price
compared to competitors. One of the key advantages of NutriChef's innovative approach is the
ability for customers to personalize their orders, tailoring each meal to their specific health
requirements and taste preferences. This level of customization, combined with the affordability
of the service, ensures that customers can enjoy tailored, healthy meals on a daily basis.
• Furthermore, the founder's visionary approach extends beyond earthly boundaries, as
demonstrated by their commitment to developing an autonomous cooking machine suitable for
outer space environments. This dedication to innovation has led to the incorporation of advanced
technologies that enable complete autonomy in food preparation. Remarkably, the achievement of
creating machine sizes similar to a double oven is an unprecedented breakthrough in the
autonomous culinary industry. Moreover, sustainability is a key aspect of the machine's design,
with a focus on optimizing resource utilization, reducing energy and water consumption, and
minimizing food waste. By prioritizing sustainability, GI Healthcare aims to create a positive
impact on both the environment and the culinary industry as a whole.

42

• The innovative nature of GI Healthcare and its visionary leadership has already garnered
recognition. The company has been selected as a finalist for the esteemed South West England
Best Innovative Start-up Award 2023, highlighting its groundbreaking contributions to the
industry. (Final results to be announced on June 15th, 2023). GI Healthcare's commitment to
pushing boundaries and embracing cutting-edge technology makes it a true trailblazer in the
culinary landscape.

Viable:
• GI Healthcare's business plan outlines a practical and economically feasible approach. The first
step involves setting up a fully functional kitchen at the UWE Campus. This kitchen will be
housed in a repurposed 12ft shipping container, equipped with essential kitchen facilities such as
a sink, water heater, fridge, dishwasher, serving tables, fire extinguishers, and space for three
AstroChef autonomous cooking machines. The cost of the shipping container, including flooring,
electrical installations, and water tank facilities, amounts to approximately £5000, and the kitchen
equipment will require an investment of around £2000.
• The AstroChef machines, which are the heart of the operation, have been meticulously developed
by our skilled team. The latest version, the AstroChef Salamouny, has already demonstrated its
capabilities by autonomously preparing five delicious meals from start to finish. The cost of
manufacturing each machine is estimated to be around £6000. We source the actuator parts from
Florida, USA (£500), motors and electronic components from Shenzhen, China (£1500), and
stainless steel & aluminium extrusion metal parts from Chennai, India (£2000). Once these parts
arrive, our team assembles them along with 3D-printed, laser-cut parts and other necessary
components (£2000) at our Pro-Bono facility, utilizing the workshop and industrial-grade 3D
printers and laser cutters available at the Bristol Robotics Lab. The assembly process, supported
by our talented team of Robotics Engineers, takes approximately a day per machine. Finally, our
proprietary AI Chef Software, responsible for automating the cooking process, is loaded onto
each machine and tested.
• The total cost for setting up the entire kitchen, including equipment and AstroChef machines,
amounts to approximately £25,000. This investment will be covered by the Founder's family
funding of £60,000, which also includes the running costs projected in the income statement of
the financial forecast.
• Extensive research and surveys have been conducted to identify the existing demand for healthy
food within the local community. The founder has acquired valuable marketing, pitching and
business skills through attending workshops organized by the Launch Space Accelerator, NatWest
Accelerator, and UK Space Agency Accelerator. Furthermore, a professional network of
experienced individuals in the food business has been established, providing ongoing support.
Strategic partnerships with suppliers, farmers, and technology manufacturers ensure a reliable
supply chain and cost-effective operations. Additionally, collaboration with UWE Head Chef and
lecturers ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.
43

• With the aim of starting operations by October 2023, the GI Healthcare team will begin selling
healthy food from the pilot kitchen. The success of the pilot will pave the way for establishing
three NutriChef Kitchens in Bristol, supported by investor funding as depicted in the financial
projections. The founder also aims to get business support from the UK Endorsing business
incubator for future SEIS fundraising. Finally, our commitment to sustainable practices aligns
with current market trends and consumer preferences, further reinforcing the viability of our
business.

Scalable:
One of the key strengths of GI Healthcare's NutriChef Kitchen is its scalability. By utilizing
shipping containers as the foundation for our kitchens, we benefit from their ability to easily
relocate to high-demand areas with minimal time and cost involved in the setup process. This
flexibility allows us to swiftly establish kitchens in various cities and communities.

Furthermore, the AstroChef machines' autonomy eliminates the need for skilled chefs, as a single
staff member can efficiently operate the entire kitchen with just 2 hours of training. This reduces the
dependency on skilled Chefs during the expansion phase and enables us to scale our kitchen
operations into new cities and countries using the franchise business model. Our kitchen technology
will be designed and manufactured in the UK, thereby the shipping container design allows for easy
shipment to other countries during our global expansion efforts.
Extensive market research conducted by GI Healthcare has revealed a clear demand in both the UK
and global markets. We have developed a well-defined 5-year roadmap for scaling up our
operations in different cities within the UK by year 5. This expansion plan will result in the creation
of 48 jobs over the next five years. With five years of experience and continuous research and
development, we will refine our kitchen technology, increase sales, and gradually expand into the
US and UAE markets in year 6 using the franchise model. It is worth noting that the UK currently
faces productivity challenges, with [56] a productivity rate 10% lower than other G7 nations,
attributed to labour shortages and slower adoption of automation. Consequently, the UK
government is [57] actively investing in Robotics & AI, embracing the growth of the robotics
market. This favourable environment positions us at the right time to start our journey in the UK
and expand globally allowing us to compete effectively against formidable competitors and make
healthy food accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere.

44

Futureg

Having successfully operated the NutriChef Kitchen for a period of over five years, we will
leverage this achievement as strong evidence of AstroChef's performance. Our next goal is to secure
a UK Defence contract to develop robust deployable kitchens with off-the-grid solar technology for
the military with the help of this evidence. Furthermore, we plan to collaborate with the United
Nations (UN) to provide assistance in disaster relief situations by offering our machines.
Additionally, the UK government is investing in a next-generation pandemic readiness unit, which
involves the rapid deployment of hospitals. We aim to contribute to this initiative by integrating our
kitchens, ensuring that patients in such critical situations have access to healthy food.
Potential Partnership:
In light of the emerging advancements in DNA
nutrition testing, we intend to collaborate with
these innovative companies to assist our
customers in identifying their precise
nutritional requirements and achieving a wellbalanced diet using our machine. This market
is experiencing rapid growth and is [58]
expected to reach a value of $1.3 billion by
2030, with a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 16.7%. By forming strategic
partnerships, our goal is to enter this expanding
market and offer our customers enhanced
benefits, expanding our reach to a wider
consumer base.

45

Space Ambition:
Our overarching vision extends beyond providing access to healthy food for humans on Earth. We
also aspire to enable future space explorers to enjoy freshly cooked, home-style meals on Mars and
beyond. This far-reaching vision has been the driving force behind our team and innovation since
day one. Presently, the cost of sending a single-pound meal to the International Space Station (ISS)
amounts to [59] approximately $18,000, while NASA estimates that sending food to a crew of six
individuals to Mars incurs a [60] delivery cost of around $2 billion. With the space exploration and
tourism industry flourishing, with companies like SpaceX planning to transport 100 space explorers
to Mars using their rocket StarShip, and Orbital Assembly launching their first Space Business Park
Hotel - Pioneer Station (accommodating 28 explorers) in 2025, followed by Voyager (a luxury hotel
with rooms for 440 space tourist) in 2030, there is a growing demand and market for innovation in
the space culinary industry.
The emergence of space farming technology, as
demonstrated by [61] NASA's successful
cultivation of food using lunar soil, has made it
feasible and optimistic to obtain fresh food
supplies on Mars. However, the absence of
cooking facilities or machinery in space poses
a challenge. GI Healthcare stands as the
world's first company to identify the expanding
demand for space food technology. Through
our innovation and ongoing research and
development efforts, we aim to provide
AstroChef machines to space habitats, starting after 2030. We are actively engaged with the UK
Space Agency Accelerator, getting support from space industry experts to achieve our extraordinary
dream and create a healthy world.
